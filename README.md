# expense-tracker-react
App for tracking expenses made with react.

# Project Creation
This app was made as part of a course in React, it made me understand state hooks, declarative approach and dynamic styling with react. Also, I've learned how react works under the hood and got confident with filtering lists and spread/rest operator. 

# My experience
Creating this app made me learn a lot and realize how much React helps development. 

## Next Objetives
As a next objective, I want to reshape the design to create something more modern for this app.
